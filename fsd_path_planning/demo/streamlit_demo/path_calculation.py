    # Path Calculation

    Path calculation is the last step of the path planning process. It receives the matched
    cones and is responsible for calculating the centerline of the track part.

    The algorithm has one parameter, the desired path length. This is because the control
    module needs a fixed length path, so for the path calculation we need to have a strategy
    for when the path that we can calculate using the cone information is too short.

    The calculation is split into three parts:

    - Base centerpoint calculation
    - Base path calculation
    - Fine path and metric calculation

    ## Fine path calculation

    The final step of the path calculation is to fine tune the path so that it can be
    used by the vehicle control module. For this 3 steps are performed:

    - The path is trimmed so that it is starts at the car pose
    - The path is extrapolated if it shorter than the desired path length or then trimmed 
    to that length if it is longer
    - The curvature of the path is calculated as a function of the arc length of the path

    The path is trimmed so that it starts at the car pose. This is done by finding the closest
    point on the path to the car pose and dropping all points before that.

    The path is extrapolated if it shorter than the desired path length. This is done by
    calculating the radius at the end of the path. Then a circle is drawn at the end of the
    path so that its length is the desired path length.

    The curvature of the path is calculated as a function of the arc length of the path. This
    is done by calculating the second derivative of the path. A uniform filter is applied to
    the second derivative to smooth it out.
